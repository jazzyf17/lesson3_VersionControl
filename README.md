## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (A Version Control System records changes to a file or multiple files over time so we are able to access specific versions later.)
2. (Add, Commit, and Push are 3 Git commands we use to move and back up files to local repository.)
3. (The 'git rm' command removes the tracked files from the staging area and from the working directory.)
