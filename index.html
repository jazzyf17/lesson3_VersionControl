            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is one main repository, or storage, for all project files. It is a system that records changes to a file or multiple files over time so we are able to access specific versions later. Utilizing a VCS is essential due to the ability to revert selected files back to the original state, revert the entire project back to the original state, see who last altered something that could possibly be causing an issue, compare changes over time, who launched an issue, and more. One of the best parts about VCS is that if mistakes are made or files are lost, it can easily be recovered. VCS is what we will be using in this course to submit our work for the world to see.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Unlike a VCS that stores files and changes over time, Git takes a snapshot of what an individual’s files look like at that moment and stores a reference of that snapshot. This is a significant difference between Git and most of all VCSs. Most of the time, Git only requires local files and resources to operate. For example, to browse history of a project, Git can easily read it from the local database rather than exiting the server. Git can also look up an old file and perform a local difference calculation to compare the current version of a file from the old one. We will be using the GitHub server to allow our websites to be seen by the world.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Two ways to gain a git repository include 1) taking a local directory that is not under version control and turn it into a Git repository, or 2) cloning an existing Git repository from elsewhere. Both result in a Git repository on a local machine. As opposed to an empty directory, to initiate version-controlling existing files consists of tracking those files and performing an initial commit. This can be achieved with a few ‘git add’ commands that identify the files that are being tracked, followed by a ‘git commit’. The command ‘git clone’ is required to get a copy of an existing Git repository. In this course, we move our local repository, Cloud 9 to a Git repository, GitHub.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes to the Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Each file in a repository can be in two states: track or untracked. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot that can be changed or staged. Untracked files are all the other files that were not in the last snapshot. All files will be tracked and unchanged when first cloning a repository since Git just checked them out and nothing has been edited. As files are edited, Git views them as modified because you have changed them since your last commit. While working, modified files are particularly staged and then modifications are committed, and the cycle repeats. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Removing Files from Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The ‘git rm’ command removes the tracked files specifically from the staging area, and then commit. This command also removes the files from the working directory so it is not seen as an untracked file in the future. If a file is only removed from the working directory, it will display as “Changes not staged for commit”. The file will be absent and no longer tracked the next time committed. Force removal ‘-f’ is a safety feature to prevent accidental removal of data has not been recorded in a snapshot and can not be recovered from Git. Another precaution is to keep the file on a hard drive but not tracked by Git. </p>
